We would like to express our deepest gratitude to Dr. Ebrahim Tarshizi, our 
mentor during our time in the University of San Diego M.S. Applied Data Science 
Program. His unwavering dedication and mentorship played a pivotal role in our 
academic journey, guiding us to successfully graduate from the program and 
pursue successful careers as data scientists.

We also extend our thanks to the Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering at the 
University of San Diego for providing an exceptional learning environment and
