Acknowledgements
=================

We would like to express our deepest gratitude to Dr. Ebrahim Tarshizi, our past mentor during our time in the University of San Diego M.S. Applied Data Science Program. His unwavering dedication and mentorship played a pivotal role in our academic journey, guiding us to successfully graduate from the program and pursue successful careers as data scientists. 

We also extend our thanks to the Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering at the University of San Diego for providing an exceptional learning environment and supporting our educational endeavors.
